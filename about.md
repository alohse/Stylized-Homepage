##Material Informatics Class - [Crystallinity Analysis in Polyethylene Molecular Dynamics](http://alohse.github.io/MIC-Polymer-MD-Simulations)
_This project was for ME8883 at Georgia Tech - Material Informatics. Throughout the course we used traditional techniques to analyze crystallinity in molecular dynamics simulations of semi-crystalline polyethylene. We also developed a new method which leverages spatial positions of monomers and uses two-point statistics to provide an estimate of the degree of crystallinity in a local region of the simulation._
